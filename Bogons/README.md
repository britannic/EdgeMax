# UBNT EdgeMax Bogon Emerging Threats Drop List

NOTE: THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL UBIQUITI SOFTWARE AND THEREFORE NOT SUPPORTED OR ENDORSED BY Ubiquiti NetworksÂ®

* Script is derived from publicly available sources and ideas

## Overview
In order to use this script, you must first configure an:

* EdgeOS firewall group with the name 'ipv4Bogons'
* Set up a cron job (recent EdgeOS versions have a CLI configurable system task-scheduler)
* A firewall (at least WAN-Local and WAN-Internal) drop rule that uses the group, i.e.:

```javascript
        network-group ipv4Bogons {
            description "ipv4 BOGON Addresses"
            network 10.0.0.0/8
            network 100.64.0.0/10
            network 127.0.0.0/8
            network 169.254.0.0/16
            network 172.16.0.0/12
            network 192.0.0.0/24
            network 192.0.2.0/24
            network 192.168.0.0/16
            network 198.18.0.0/15
            network 198.51.100.0/24
            network 203.0.113.0/24
            network 224.0.0.0/4
            network 240.0.0.0/4
        }

        rule 3 {
            action drop
            description "Drop IPv4 bogons"
            source {
                group {
                    network-group ipv4Bogons
                }
            }
        }
```

## Features

## Compatibility
* bogon.py has been tested on the EdgeRouter Lite family of routers, versions v1.6.0-v1.8.0alpha.
* Since the EdgeOS is a fork and port of Vyatta 6.3, this script could easily be adapted to work on VyOS and Vyatta derived ports
