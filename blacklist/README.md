NOTE: THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL UBIQUITI SOFTWARE AND THEREFORE NOT SUPPORTED OR ENDORSED BY Ubiquiti NetworksÂ®

## Overview
EdgeMax dnsmasq Blacklist and Adware Blocking is derived from the received wisdom found at (https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/bd-p/EdgeMAX)

## Licenses
* GNU General Public License, version 3
* GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3

## Features
* Generates configuration files used directly by dnsmasq to redirect dns lookups
* Integrated with the EdgeMax OS CLI
* Any FQDN in the blacklist will force dnsmasq to return the configured dns redirect IP address

## Compatibility
* update-dnsmasq.pl has been tested on the EdgeRouter Lite family of routers, version v1.6.0-v1.9.0.
* Since the EdgeOS is a fork and port of Vyatta 6.3, this script could be adapted to work on VyOS and Vyatta derived ports

## Versions
* v3.6: Enhancements
    - Ability to add a source that uses a local file instead of HTTP

            set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts source myhosts description 'Blacklist file source'
            set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts source myhosts dns-redirect-ip 10.10.10.1
            set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts source myhosts file /config/user-data/blist.hosts.src

    - file contents example for /config/user-data/blist.hosts.src:

            gsmtop.net
            click.buzzcity.net

- Additional excludes added based on user feedback
- Minor optimizations and additional tests added
- Setup commands now include PURGE to clean up stale config sessions:

| # | Option  |                         Function                          |
|---|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | INSTALL |Install dnsmasq blacklist CLI configuration functionality|
| 2 | REMOVE  |Remove dnsmasq blacklist CLI configuration functionality|
| 3 | TEST    |Validate dnsmasq blacklist CLI configuration functionality|
| 4 | BACKUP  |Save blacklist configuration to /config/user-data/blacklist.cmds|
| 5 | PURGE   |Clean up stale config sessions|
| 5 | QUIT    |Exit the installer|

* v3.5: Updates/fixes include:
    - Global exclude is now available ([set service dns forwarding blacklist exclude ...])
    - Removed --debug option from update-dnsmasq.pl
    - New validator script (/configure/scripts/blacklist.t) runs a battery of tests on the blacklist configuration to ensure it is working correctly or checks it is removed correctly
    - Setup/Remove scripts rewritten in Perl
    - Fixed issue with install that prevented admin user configuration
    - Installer now runs under admin and only uses sudo where absolutely necessary
    - Installer checks to see if service dns forwarding is configured and bails it if not with warning/example configuration
    - Installer includes these new options:
    - Non-essential functions have been pruned, command line switches reduced to:

            /config/scripts/update-dnsmasq.pl -h
            usage: update-dnsmasq.pl <options>
            options:
                -f <file>   # load a configuration file
                --help      # show help and usage text
                -v          # verbose output
                --version   # show program version number

| # | Option  |                         Function                          |
|---|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

| 4 | BACKUP  |Save blacklist configuration to /config/user-data/blacklist.cmds|
| 5 | QUIT    |Exit the installer|

---
* v3.3.2: What is new:
    - Non-essential functions have been pruned, command line switches reduced to:

            /config/scripts/update-dnsmasq.pl -h
            usage: update-dnsmasq.pl <options>
            options:
                --debug     # enable debug output
                -f <file>   # load a configuration file
                --help      # show help and usage text
                -v          # verbose output
                --version   # show program version number

    - Improved exclusion list rejection
    - Ability to create a domain list from a source that has FQDNs using the new 'compress' switch (note, use with caution, since you may find legit domains getting completely blocked - especially cloud services like amazonaws, in that case you will need to add specific excludes):

            set service dns forwarding blacklist domains source FQDNs_Source compress true

    - Install/remove scripts rewritten in Perl for better error checking
    - Install/remove logs will be written to /var/log for diagnostics
    - Flagged domain list with optional include commands written to /var/log/update-dnsmasq_flagged_domains.cmds
    - Each source will be written to its own file:

            root@ubnt:/etc/dnsmasq.d# ls
            README
            domains.malc0de.com.blacklist.conf
            domains.pre-configured.blacklist.conf
            hosts.adaway.blacklist.conf
            hosts.hpHosts.blacklist.conf
            hosts.pre-configured.blacklist.conf
            hosts.someonewhocares.org.blacklist.conf
            hosts.winhelp2002.mvps.org.blacklist.conf
            hosts.www.malwaredomainlist.com.blacklist.conf
            hosts.yoyo.org.blacklist.conf

    - Log file (/var/log/update-dnsmasq.pl) now flags frequently blacklisted domains, so you can optionally decide to add them as an include under domains:

            root@ubnt:/etc/dnsmasq.d# tail -n 30 /var/log/update-dnsmasq.log

    - Improved memory usage for threads has been implemented
    - Uses HTTP::Tiny for smaller memory footprint with threads
    - Optional -f config.boot parser has been completely rewritten, so that the XorpConfigParser.pm module is no longer required (saves on memory overhead and compilation time)
    - Over 70% of the code has been rewritten or updated

* Version History:
---
* v3.24d: Updates include:
    - 'hosts' exclusions now incorporates 'domains' exclusions and blacklists
    - Additional 'good hosts' excluded from blacklisting in the supplied install configuration
    - Fixes excluded FQDNs by using precise matching instead of fuzzy (i.e. 1.domain.tld won't also exclude b1.domain.tld)
    - Entire blacklist can be disabled using 'set service dns forwarding blacklist disabled true'
    - Ability to add domain sources, which compile to domain.blacklist.conf allowing for domain wildcards, so that all hosts in a domain will now be blocked
    - Exclude and include lists have been moved and now apply to their parent area, e.g. 'hosts' or 'domains'
    - New --disable switch enables ADBlock by setting [set service dns forwarding blacklist enabled false]
    - New --enable switch enables ADBlock by setting [set service dns forwarding blacklist enabled true]
    - Now uses multi-threading for simultaneous blacklist downloads
    - Revamped stream processor, now has ability to extract multiple FQDNs from each line or input
    - Useragent: HTTP get requests now include browser agent information to prevent website robot rejection
    - Useragent: HTTP/HTTPS handling uses useragent for improved error/timeout control
    - Uses own node.def to maintain configuration changes. This also forces the script to run the dnsmasq configuration update after DNS is up during boot time
---
* 3.22rc1: Updates include:
    - Fixes excluded FQDNs by using precise matching instead of fuzzy (i.e. 1.domain.tld won't also exclude b1.domain.tld)
    - New --disable switch enables ADBlock by setting [set service dns forwarding blacklist enabled false]
    - New --doc switch prints out condensed man page
    - New --enable switch enables ADBlock by setting [set service dns forwarding blacklist enabled true]
    - Now uses multi-threading for simultaneous blacklist downloads
    - Revamped stream processor, now has ability to extract multiple FQDNs from each line or input
    - Useragent: HTTP get requests now include browser agent information to prevent website robot rejection
    - Useragent: HTTP/HTTPS handling uses useragent for improved error/timeout control
    - Uses own node.def to maintain configuration changes. This also forces the script to run the dnsmasq configuration update after DNS is up during boot time
    - Uses own node.def to maintain configuration changes. This also forces the script to run the dnsmasq configuration update after DNS is up during router boot time
---
* 3.15: Added features include:
    - Logging to /var/log/update-blacklists-dnsmasq.log
    - --debug option: prints status messages
    - Additional download sources added to the default lists
    - Added retry logic for download sources that time out (inspired by @mseeEngineerï»¿)
    - Task scheduler update interval is now every 6 hours, as some of the sources change hourly (configure interval using "set system task-scheduler task update_blacklists interval"
    - Status line retains previous downloads for more detail
---
* Version 3.12: Fixed bug reported by @soehestï»¿ where certain FQDNs were being rejected by the stream processor.
---
* Version 3.10: Now supports https:// source URLs and improved regex handling in the stream processing engine.
---
* Version 3.00: No longer requires regex strings, just the line prefix/preamble before the hostname in the download. If a version of ADBlock was installed previously, you will need to select option 2 to remove it and then install this version. This is necessary to ensure the configure paths are correctly set up for the new prefix option which replaces the regex string.
---
## Installation

To install:

* upload install_adblock.v3.24a.tgz to your router (ensure you modify the command if you want to install an older version)
    - curl -o /tmp/install_adblock.v3.24a.tgz http://community.ubnt.com/ubnt/attachments/ubnt/EdgeMAX/78132/34/install_adblock.v3.24a.tgz
    - sudo tar zxvf ./install_adblock.v3.24a.tgz
    - sudo bash ./install_adblock.v3.24a.tgz
    - select menu option #1 if installing for the first time
    - select menu option #2 to completely remove ADBlock if you have a previous version, then run install again using option #1

* Now run configure and make certain your DHCP services don't give out public nameservers, otherwise they will defeat the dnsmasq redirects:

        delete service dhcp-server shared-network-name <YOUR DHCP SERVICE NAME> subnet <YOUR SUBNET> dns-server <PUBLIC NAME SERVER i.e. 8.8.8.8>

* Now make sure EACH of your DHCP services (for the subnets you want to block adverts and malware servers) gives out the router as the only nameserver (LAN1 and the subnet should be replaced with your own system values):

        set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN1 subnet 192.168.1.0/24 dns-server 192.168.1.1

* The script has a menu to either add or remove (if previously installed) AdBlock. It will set up the system task scheduler (cron) via the CLI to run "/config/scripts/update-blacklists-dnsmasq.pl" at mindnight local time.

## Post Installation
Here is the scheduler configuration after running install_adblock:

```python
    show system task-scheduler
     task update_blacklists {
         executable {
             path /config/scripts/update-blacklists-dnsmasq.pl
         }
         interval 6h
     }
```
The script will also install a default blacklist setup, here is the stanza (show service dns forwarding):

```python
    blacklist {
        disabled false
        dns-redirect-ip 0.0.0.0
        domains {
            exclude adobedtm.com

    set system task-scheduler task update_blacklists interval 6h

## Notes:
In order to make this work properly, you will need to first ensure that your dnsmasq is correctly set up. An example configuration is posted below:

    show service dns forwarding
     cache-size 2048
     listen-on eth0
     listen-on eth2
     listen-on lo
     name-server 208.67.220.220
     name-server 208.67.222.222
     name-server 2620:0:ccc::2
     name-server 2620:0:ccd::2
     options expand-hosts
     options bogus-priv
     options localise-queries
     options domain=ubnt.home
     options strict-order
     options listen-address=127.0.0.1
     system

## Removal
* sudo bash ./install_adblock.v3.24a
* select option #2
