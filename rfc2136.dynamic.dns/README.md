NOTE: THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL UBIQUITI SOFTWARE AND THEREFORE NOT SUPPORTED OR ENDORSED BY Ubiquiti NetworksÂ®

## Overview
This has been successfully tested on an ERL-3 Lite v1.7.0-v1.9.1, to add DDNS support for Cloudflare and RFC2136

## Licenses
* See LICENSE.txt

## Features
* Currently redesigning to deprecate the patch install method, to a stand alone installer for current and future EdgeOS versions

## Compatibility
* Tested on the EdgeRouter ER-L routers, versions v1.7.0-v1.9.1.
* Since EdgeOS is a fork and port of Vyatta 6.3, these scripts could easily be adapted to work on VyOS and Vyatta derived ports
