NOTE: THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL UBIQUITI SOFTWARE AND THEREFORE NOT SUPPORTED OR ENDORSED BY Ubiquiti NetworksÂ®

## Overview
EdgeMax Blacklist and Ad Server Blocking is derived from the received wisdom found at (https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/bd-p/EdgeMAX)

## Licenses
* GNU General Public License, version 3
* GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3

## Features
* Generates a dnsmasq configuration file that can be used directly by dnsmasq
* Integrated with the EdgeMax OS CLI
* Any fqdn in the blacklist will return the configured Blackhole IP address

## Compatibility
* update-blacklists-dnsmasq.pl has been tested on the EdgeRouter Lite family of routers, version v1.6.0-v1.7.0.
* Since the EdgeOS is a fork and port of Vyatta 6.3, this script could easily be adapted for work on VyOS and Vyatta derived ports

## Installation

To install:

* upload install_adblock.tgz to your router (e.g. scp <local path>/ersetup.tgz <user>@<erl router>:/tmp/install_adblock.tgz
* on your router: cd /tmp; sudo tar zxvf /tmp/install_adblock.tgz
* sudo bash /tmp/install_adblock
* The script has a menu to either add or remove (if previously installed) AdBlock. It will set up the system task scheduler (cron) via the CLI to run "/config/scripts/update-blacklists-dnsmasq.pl" at mindnight local time.

## Post Installation
Here is the scheduler configuration after running install_adblock:

```javascript
show system task-scheduler
 task update_blacklists {
     executable {
         path /config/scripts/update-blacklists-dnsmasq.pl
     }
     interval 1d
 }
```
The script will also install a default blacklist setup, here is the stanza (show service dns forwarding):

```javascript
 dns {
        forwarding {
            blacklist {
                blackhole 0.0.0.0
                exclude msdn.com
